### 1. **Importing the required module**
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
```
- `playwright.sync_api`: This imports the **synchronous API** of the Playwright library, which allows you to automate browser interactions.
- `sync_playwright`: This is a context manager that allows you to use Playwright in a synchronous manner (i.e., executing step-by-step rather than using async/await).

---

### 2. **Define a function to run the script**
```python
def run():
```
- `run()` is a Python function that contains the steps for automating browser interaction using Playwright.

---

### 3. **Create a context manager to initialize Playwright**
```python
    with sync_playwright() as p:
```
- `with sync_playwright()` creates a context manager that ensures proper setup and teardown of the Playwright environment.
- `p` is an instance of the Playwright class that provides access to different browser types (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`).

---

### 4. **Launch the Chromium browser**
```python
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False, channel="chrome")
```
- `p.chromium` â€“ This accesses the Chromium browser (which includes Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge).
- `launch()` â€“ Starts the browser instance.
  - `headless=False` â€“ Opens the browser in **non-headless** mode (visible mode). If set to `True`, the browser runs in the background (invisible).
  - `channel="chrome"` â€“ Specifies that the browser should run in **Google Chrome** rather than the default Chromium build.

---

### 5. **Open a new browser tab (or page)**
```python
        page = browser.new_page()
```
- `browser.new_page()` creates a new browser tab or window.
- `page` object represents the tab, allowing you to interact with the page (navigate, click buttons, enter text, etc.).

---

### 6. **Navigate to a URL**
```python
        page.goto("https://www.google.com")
```
- `page.goto()` â€“ Navigates the browser to the specified URL.
- `"https://www.google.com"` â€“ The target URL (in this case, Google's homepage).

---

### 7. **Print the page title**
```python
        print(page.title())
```
- `page.title()` â€“ Returns the title of the web page.
- `print()` â€“ Outputs the title to the console.

---

### 8. **Close the browser**
```python
        browser.close()
```
- `browser.close()` â€“ Closes the browser and ends the session.
- This is important to free up system resources and avoid memory leaks.

---

### 9. **Run the function if the script is executed directly**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```
- `if __name__ == "__main__":` â€“ Ensures that the script runs only if it's executed directly (not imported as a module).
- `run()` â€“ Calls the `run()` function to start the script.

---

### âœ… **What this script does:**
1. Launches a Chrome browser.
2. Opens a new tab.
3. Navigates to Google's homepage.
4. Prints the page title in the terminal.
5. Closes the browser. 

---

### ðŸ”¥ **Common Issues and Fixes:**
1. **Playwright not installed** â€“ Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Channel not found** â€“ If `"chrome"` is not available, try using `"msedge"` or removing the `channel` option:
   ```python
   browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
   ```

3. **Permissions error on Linux/macOS** â€“ Try running:
   ```bash
   playwright install --with-deps
   ```
